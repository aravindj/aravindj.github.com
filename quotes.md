Enjoy your life to the fullest

The best way to predict the future is to invent it

The journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.

Arise! Awake! And stop not till the goal is reached

Almost everything you do will seem insignificant, but it is important that you do it

Love does not claim possession, but gives freedom

The happiest people DO NOT necessarily have the BEST THINGS. They simply appreciate the things they have.

Be who you are & say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.

Simple living and high thinking lead to fulfillment and freedom!
