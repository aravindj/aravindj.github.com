Saw this awesome poem in my colleague's desk. Pretty inspiring!

*If you want a thing bad enough  
To go out and fight for it,  
Work day and night for it,  
Give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it  
If only desire of it  
Makes you quite mad enough  
Never to tire of it,  
Makes you hold all other things tawdry and cheap for it  
If life seems all empty and useless without it  
And all that you scheme and you dream is about it,  
If gladly you'll sweat for it,  
Fret for it,  
Plan for it,  
Lose all your terror of God or man for it,  
If you'll simply go after that thing that you want,  
With all your capacity,  
Strength and sagacity,  
Faith, hope and confidence, stern pertinacity,  
If neither cold poverty, famished and gaunt,  
Nor sickness nor pain  
Of body or brain  
Can turn you away from the thing that you want,  
If dogged and grim you besiege and beset it,  
You'll get it!*

-- Berton Braley
