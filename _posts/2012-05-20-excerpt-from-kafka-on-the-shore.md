I have been reading Haruki Murakami's 'Kafka on the shore' for sometime now 
and got stumbled upon a very good paragraph and thought of sharing it here. It goes
like this...

*"Adults are forever raising the bar on clever children, precisely because they're
able to handle it. The children get overwhelmed by the tasks they are set and gradually
lose the sort of openness and sense of accomplishment they naturally have. When
they're treated like that, children start to crawl inside a shell and keep everything
inside. It takes a lot of time and effort to get them to open up again. Kids' heart
are malleable, but once they gel it's hard to get them back the way they were. Next
to impossible, in most cases..."

An excerpt which exactly describes bad parenting approach.
