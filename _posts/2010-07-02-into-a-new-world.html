<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;">I think its time to say that now am a software professional(You should believe me because i am blogging from my office now&nbsp;<img class="wp-smiley" style="max-width: 600px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1253809441g" alt=":-)" />&nbsp;). I have been posted in a branch at Gurgaon for undergoing training.So I am actually into a new world both in lifestyle terms (college to company) and also in geographic terms (Madurai to Gurgaon). I would like to brief the geographic change. First of all when I boarded the train for Delhi, I started hearing Hindi.Even though there were Tamil people, I needed a translator for interacting with those pantry-walas.As the train moved, the intensity of Tamil &lsquo;air&rsquo; reduced gradually.The second big thing is the one which all expects &ndash; the food.The moment I entered the train I thought I was surrounded by chappatis and dals and of course occasionally rice.But I got used to it in couple of days.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;">To say about Gurgaon, its a good city(if you dont go into interior part of it&nbsp;<img class="wp-smiley" style="max-width: 600px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1253809441g" alt=":-)" />&nbsp;) about 20 kms away from Delhi.I stay in&nbsp; an area called Palam Vihar, an area with full of rich people.You cant see any 2 wheelers there.But you can see BMWs and Honda citys anytime and anywhere.The houses were built artistically.The roadways layout were well organised.Yet you can see heavy traffic most of the times.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;">I have nothing to say about my company life since I hadn&rsquo;t yet really started it.But no matter.. Its time to change my &lsquo;About&rsquo; page&nbsp;<img class="wp-smiley" style="max-width: 600px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif?m=1253809441g" alt=":-P" /></p>
