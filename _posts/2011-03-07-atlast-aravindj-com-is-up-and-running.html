<p>Finally.. I managed to get my domain up and running. It took a long 2 months for finishing this website.So, for these 2 months, I learned a lot of things like managing the domain, setting up google apps and google analytics, learning rails etc.</p>
<p>Still there are lots of stuffs to be done.Am looking forward  to do that.Some of them are - adding twitter updates for each blog post, making the banner look better (presently i suppose it looks better in lcd) etc.</p>
<p>I have deployed this site in heroku with a single dyno.So am presently availing the free service provided by heroku.Am not sure about the performance it would offer.So should consider a switch over if any mishap occurs.</p>
<p>At this time I would like to thank Madangopal for helping me to get this site up.Without him it would have taken much longer.Thanks buddy :)</p>
<p>BTW, am looking for your genuine feedback.I would be happy to hear from you. Thanks.Will catch you soon in my next blog post :)</p>
