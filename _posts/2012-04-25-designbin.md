Now a days, launching a website has become a piece of cake and there is no excuse for
not trying out things. The best part is, it has become absolutely free to get that
thing from your mind and put it in the browser. On that note, and intending to try out
bottle.py, twitter bootstrap and amazon aws, I have created <a href="http://designb.in/">designbin</a>. Its an app for uploading your
temporary design (html, css & image files) and get an url for those files, which you
can share with people and get feedback.

You can get to look at the code <a href="https://github.com/aravindj/Designbin">here</a>

Try and see if its useful for you!
