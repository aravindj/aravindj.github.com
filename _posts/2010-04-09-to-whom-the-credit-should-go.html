<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2 days before I came across a short autobiography of the Nobel laureate, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan in The Hindu.&nbsp;<a style="color: #2970a6; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" title="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article391164.ece" href="http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article391164.ece" target="_blank">ï»¿http://beta.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article391164.ece</a></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">After reading a few passages of his early life, I thought the credit of being a Nobel laureate should not actually go to him. All the credits (in my opinion) should go to their parents actually. He has indicated that both his mother and father had obtained Ph.D during the 1950s period.Now just try to imagine the awareness of most of the people from India at that age. Probably it is the age of my grandfather and I am damn sure it was exceptional to have that kind of awareness at that period.Especially I have to mention that his mother, Rajalakshmi, had done a Ph.D and that too within 18 months.Wow.. Isn&rsquo;t that exceptional??&nbsp; Now I realize that our country had wasted many human resource by the name of male chauvinism.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">With this kind of background, it is no wonder that he ended up in a Nobel prize.</p>
