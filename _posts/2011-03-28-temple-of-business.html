<p>A couple of couple of weeks (yeah 4 weeks :-) ) before, I along with  my parents decided to make a *trip* to Iskcon *temple* (Bangalore) after  having considered many other options. We set out for the trip on a  flashy sunday by around 8'o clock from Basavangudi. After a tiring  journey of around 1 and 1/2 hour we made it to the temple. Initially I  got awed by their professionalism with their well designed provisions  for footwear, carry bags and stuffs, their provisions for security check  and the cleanliness they maintained and the like. Later, the opinions  got dislocated.</p>
<p>After attending the security check, we have been 'routed' to a couple  of shrines where we don't have any kind of deepaaradhana (sorry i don't  know what is it in English :-P) nor some kind of poojas. When you get  yourself to the top of the queue, the only thing you will find next to  statue is the hundial. Also, one thing you will notice there is that,  you will be routed through all the shrines ( from shrine 1 to shrine  2).You cannot move between shrines willingly nor you can rest in any  place.You have to follow the queue and it will take you all along to  your destination. I suppose these people haven't seen meenakshi amman  temple where you have to discover your way in and way out.(I can read  your mind that I shouldn't compare these two. But still...) It gives you  some kind of freedom i suppose.</p>
<p>When you make it to the main shrine, a big hall, you will again be  directed to a queue.This is ,say, not a special entrance.This ordinary  entrance queue will be some 2 mts away from the statue. If you would  like to have a special entrance it will cost around 50 or 100 bucks  (which i am not sure, but sure enough that its costly :-P) and this  special entrance is none other than the other side of a metal separator  between normal and special entrances.</p>
<p>Once you find your way out of the normal entrance, there will be a  showcase of books and cds in very many languages. I just window-shopped  those books on my way, where I have been stopped by a person. He called  me "sir.. sir..". I just looked around wondering whether the voice is  calling me.Yes, it is. A person fought out the crowd and handed over a  small krishna photo to me and said hello. I responded. He inquired about  me and my profession and then just started briefing about the books  they have and their values.He just asked me whether I need any books. I  told him that I have been to that temple a couple of times and I have  bought several books and so I don't need any (in a traditional tone of&nbsp;  "I already bought this from u and so will contact you in case I need any  more" to a general sales person for escapism :-)).But to that reply, he  started asking what books I bought and how I felt about those and the  like (oh no! :-)).It turned out to be a tough time to escape from him  :-P. In this way, they keep on canvasing many people like me, which I  felt is too bad for a temple. Selling of books is good.But marketing of  those, doesn't suit the organization.</p>
<p>Apart from all these the highlight is that they have a nice food  court.Oh sorry! they call it as prasadham :-P. The only thing is that a  single ladoo of prasadham costs around 40 rs (too cheap huh :-)).I still  remember our industrial visit to Bangalore where around hundred of us  finished the breakfast in iskcon temple :-P. You may think 'whats wrong  in that' ?but you will not feel so when you have already visited a  temple like shirdi where they serve, a very big hall full of persons, 3  times a day and that too at no cost. Ah! don't tell me it got lots of  funds and Iskcon is raising funds by all these above mentioned means so  that they can start providing food for poor people one day, just like  shirdi.For your information iskcon is a very big organization.</p>
<p>With all these kind of experiences, which although doesn't affect me  in any way but still makes me to give a thought about, I am convinced  that the temple near my pg hostel is a lot better than all these. You  will come to know what is peace there (except for festive times when it  is crowded). You will have a chanting box to soothe your ears, silence  to calm your mind and place to sit and meditate (if really you r willing  :P).</p>
